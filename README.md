- Currently working on in R:
  - Luciernaga: Tools for quality control and signature evaluation of SFC unmixing controls
  - Coereba: How heterogenous are the cells within your SFC panels
  - InstrumentQC: An automated dashboard for monitoring Cytek Aurora Instrument QC data

- Fun fact: Ultramarathon's are really just food festivals. They are generally run on trails out in nature, there's no shame in hiking the hill, and the aid stations every three miles have food that is to die for. And if that wasn't enough to make you want to sign up, some even give out hand-crafted coffee mugs to finishers.
